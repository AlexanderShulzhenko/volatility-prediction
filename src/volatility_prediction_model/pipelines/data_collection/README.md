# Data collection

Data collection pipeline provides scripts to scrap Bainance REST API in order to get data for the model. To main data sources used in the current project are:
- Candlestick data (OHLC);
- Trades data.

## Candlestick data

## Trades data
Trades data is leveraged to build unit-trades features by analysing the patterns of trades behavior before each timestamp in the master list. Pulling trades data is non-trivial exercise since the amount of data that should be pulled is huge and API calls take quite a while. Best practice to accelerate the requests is to use the async programming. We leveraged `aiohttp` library to make async API calls. Due to API limits imposed by Binance we had to introduce a special data structure called `branch`, where the collection of all branches are built on a `spine`.

### Branch
> Branch is a structure (python class) that is defined as:
