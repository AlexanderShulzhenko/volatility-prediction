# Data collection

![data_collection](https://github.com/AlexanderShulzhenko/volatility-prediction/assets/80621503/3118d39d-c9fb-4c7d-b673-c00a6b21d3d0)

Data collection pipeline provides scripts to scrap Bainance REST API in order to get data for the model. To main data sources used in the current project are:
- Candlestick data (OHLC);
- Trades data.

## Candlestick data
Collection of the candlestick data is a straightforward task due to the chosen frame. On the 15-min frame the volumes of candlestick data are low, so ordinary (sync) data collection is applicable. The data is pulled on monthly level and saved to the Parquet files, which are used to form a `kedro.PartitionedDataset` for data combination pipeline.

## Trades data
> ***Note***: trades pulling script is optimized in the way that it is limited ONLY by the Binance API restrictions (which are 6000 weights / minute). This step could take some time.

Trades data is leveraged to build unit-trades features by analysing the patterns of trades behavior before each timestamp in the master list. Pulling trades data is non-trivial exercise since the amount of data that should be pulled is huge and API calls take quite a while. Best practice to accelerate the requests is to use the async programming. We leveraged `aiohttp` library to make async API calls. Due to API limits imposed by Binance we had to introduce a special data structure called `branch`, where the collection of all branches are built on a `spine`. We are pulling data in batches (see figure above) not to violate API limits.

### Branch
> Branch is a structure (class in Python) that is defined as:
> ```python
> class branch:
>    def __init__(
>        self, flag: bool, trades_dct_list: List[Dict[str, Any]], start_stamp: str, end_stamp: str
>    )
>        self.flag = flag
>        self.trades_dct_list = trades_dct_list
>        self.start_stamp = start_stamp
>        self.end_stamp = end_stamp
> ```

Branch is used to track all the batches pulled by an algorithm.

> Batch is the list of lists of *n* trades (where `n=1000` in our case), where each list of *n* trades correspond to a particular timestamp (see figure above).

When the batch is pulled it is distributed accordingly to the branches. When the branch is finished, i.e., when the latest trade timestamp is greater than specified in the branch definition, `flag` variable is assigned with `True`. This data structure helps to keep track of all trades lists with quering only those which are still not finished.

> Spine is the basement for all branches, which is declared as list of empty branches.

#### Memory limit pitfalls
The model was trained on the server with 8GB RAM, which imposed constraints on the `spine` size. To overcome this obstacle we first pulled the data in batches and saved it, and after the loading step we built the spine using `build_spine_from_batches()` function.

To asses the performance of the script the `API_calls.png` plot is generated based on the timings. The API calls made from the training server are presented below:
